### What I learned
•	I learned some basics about touch designer, TOPs are 2D image operators. I also learned about X, Y, and Z modifiers such as translation, rotation, and scaling. I figured out what each did, and the sensitivity of each slider.

### What I made
•	After learning about how TOPs work, I played around with them to make a simple text png on top of an animated white, black, and grey background. It is very crude so for the purpose of being sensitive towards those with epilepsy, I am simply including an image. I horizontally stretched the text so some of it doesn't show on the picture. I liked the noise function because it reminded me of snow camouflage. I used pink because I like the color pink.

### Connection to the project
This is connected to the course because TouchDesigner is a computer program that is used to make projection art. It is connected to my team's project because my skills in TouchDesigner will help us to achieve our goal of projecting art onto a sphere. If I can learn how to stretch the image onto a spherical plane, then we can start making really cool images to display.
