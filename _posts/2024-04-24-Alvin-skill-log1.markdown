### What I Learned
I learned a bit about touch designer and managed to recreate the abstract fluid simulation alongside the tutorial. I followed a tutorial on YouTube to get a handle on the basics and found that might help with the project. Although it was quite confusing as first, I quickly found my own work arounds and began following along. I learned a tiny bit of coding and how to disconnect and connect the different operators.

### Artifac 1

### Reflection
Somethings I learned in the process are the operators’ functions, buttons, and some of the short cuts. Along the way, I found myself in an unfamiliar situation before managing to solve it on my own by scrolling in after accidentally scrolling out too far and getting confused. I managed to make the abstract wave simulation as the tutorial showed, but likely with some slight differences with the arrangement with the operators and experiments when I came across something that didn’t match the tutorial.

### Artifact 2

### Relation
All these efforts tie back to the class as this application can be used to create a variety of visual arts of different shapes and patterns. This can help with the project as I want to learn how I can make clouds and hurricane patterns for the earth model. I want it have as much realism as possible, and to do so, there should be cloud formation and weather. these formation should also move and behave randomly to show the random weather than a pattern of predictable movements.
