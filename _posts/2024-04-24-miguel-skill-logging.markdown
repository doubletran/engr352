### What I learned
During this project phase, I learned to use TouchDesigner for projecting on spherical surfaces, drawing on resources like TouchDesigner documentation and community guides. These helped me understand spatial mapping and synchronization, essential for managing visual alignments. This knowledge was vital in translating theoretical concepts into practical application, supporting our project's technical needs.

### What I made
I developed a TouchDesigner control system to precisely manage multiple projectors via a separate monitor interface. This required iterative testing for accurate synchronization. The interface includes tools for adjusting projection parameters like edge blending and keystone correction on a spherical surface. Initially tested in simulations, the system was later trialed with actual projectors, providing critical practical insights.

### Connection to the project
I developed skills in TouchDesigner for our class project, which aims to project realistic imagery onto a weather balloon, simulating Earth. These advanced projection mapping techniques are essential for creating an immersive visual experience and adjusting to different lighting conditions and viewing angles during live presentations.
