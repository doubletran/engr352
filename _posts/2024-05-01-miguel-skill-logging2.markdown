### What I learned
This phase of the project enhanced my ability to use TouchDesigner for system design and introduced me to advanced version control techniques using Git. I engaged with a variety of materials, including system design books, technical articles, and YouTube tutorials focused on Git. These resources deepened my understanding of digital environment management and the importance of effective version control in collaborative projects. Learning to integrate various system components and manage changes through Git was crucial for our team's development process.

### What I made
I created the "Master_SpaceWalk.toe" file, a comprehensive and modular TouchDesigner setup designed to integrate smoothly with Git, facilitating version control and collaboration. This setup is constructed to be adaptable and scalable, catering to the evolving needs of our project. The layout is meticulously organized to ensure that modifications by team members are straightforward and that the system remains robust for live performance use.

### Connection to the project
The development of the "Master_SpaceWalk" file is integral to our project, "Space Walk." It serves as the operational core for our visual projection, which will depict the Earth on a spherical surface during live presentations. By enhancing the system design and incorporating effective version control, I have contributed significantly to ensuring that our visual outputs are both dynamic and precise, vital for achieving an immersive experience in the final presentation.
