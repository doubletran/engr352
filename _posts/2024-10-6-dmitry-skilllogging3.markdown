Skill Logging 3


(20 points) Brief reflection/recountment of what you learned (200 words maximum). Specifically, you will likely need to do independent reading/searching to learn some of these new skills. Where did you look, and what did you read or learn about? Include references as appropriate (you should have at least one in most cases), and make sure the writing is in your own words. For the purposes of this assignment, it is not sufficient to learn without external resources.
	This skill log I learned how to work on github. While I did use it in one class prior I never learned how to use it for and in a group setting. To learn about this skill I worked with my teammates and they walked me through the upload process, how to create a website, and how to edit something for the whole team. I also learned from some online sources such as github themselves which I linked below. I used github to upload my assignments for this class and help work on the shared documents.

(15 points) Artifact related to what you learned (i.e., an image or video from your specific efforts). Note that this should be captured by you and not (for example) images copied from a tutorial that you used. This part should capture your attempt to follow or digest the learning material in some way (for example, a screenshot or photo showing your own work beside a tutorial page, a photo of you attending a relevant crafting workshop, etc.).

(20 points) Brief reflection/recounting of what you made (200 words maximum). For example, you might have tried making art in a new style or using a new software, learned a new makerspace skill, written code in a new language, etc. Tell me about this process.

As part of my learning experience with GitHub, I worked on creating a team website and uploading assignments to a shared repository. One significant challenge I encountered was managing images within our project files. This process involved uploading images to the repository and then referencing them correctly in our documents and web pages. While I got to uploading them fine I still didnâ€™t know how to import them into documents. So, I then learned how to reference them using syntax with github, which Tran Tran helped me with.


(15 points) Artifact related to what you made (same instructions/stipulations as for the first mentioned artifact). Building on the previously mentioned examples, you might have produced/shared a final art piece, taken a video of part of the process or snapshot of the final product, or made a screen recording of you running your code for the first time, for example.


(15 points) Tie this effort back into the class by briefly describing how it connects to both the course topic and your team's project (150 words maximum).

Github connects to our class as it's the backbone of our team, all our assignments were uploaded with github and then put into the team website. I feel github ties in well to the collaboration part of class as it's a community based worksite, letting us all contribute.
