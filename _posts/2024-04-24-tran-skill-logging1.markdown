### What I learned
•	(20 points) Brief reflection/recountment of what you learned (200 words maximum). Specifically, you will likely need to do independent reading/searching to learn some of these new skills. Where did you look, and what did you read or learn about? Include references as appropriate, and make sure the writing is in your own words.
•	(15 points) Artifact related to what you learned (i.e., an image or video from your specific efforts). Note that this should be captured by you and not (for example) media copied from a tutorial that you used.

### What I made
•	(20 points) Brief reflection/recountment of what you made (200 words maximum). For example, you might have tried making art in a new style or using a new software, learned a new makerspace skill, written code in a new language, etc. Tell me about this process.
•	(15 points) Artifact related to what you made (same instructions/stipulations as for the first mentioned artifact). Building on the previously mentioned examples, you might have produced/shared a final art piece, taken a video of part of the process or snapshot of the final product, or made a screen recording of you running your code for the first time, for example.

### Connection to the project
•	(15 points) Tie this effort back into the class by briefly describing how it connects to the course topic and your team's project (150 words maximum).
