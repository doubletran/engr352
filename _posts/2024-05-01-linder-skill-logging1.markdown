### What I learned
Today I learned how to use SOPs, which are basically 3D model generators and editors. Using a randomized eidting tool on a sphere, I found out how to edit things such as its color or shape in real time.

### What I made
After my findings on color, I decided to use the same hyperbolic spiraling pattern with a very basic model editor, and it looked something like the poles of the Earth being physically twisted.

### Connection to the project
With this knowledge I can perhaps create a wave-like effect on a celestial body with water, or I can create a colorful iridescent effect on a celestial body. We can also use a way to turn TOPs into SOPs to see what our final product may look like if it were modelled.
