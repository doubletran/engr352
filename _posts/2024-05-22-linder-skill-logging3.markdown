### What I learned
I've learned practical applications for mounting weather balloons and projectors to create the art piece we wanted. I learned that mounting things to ceilings without damaging them is much easier said than done, and through a few hours of problem solving, I was able to get it working well. However, we found that keeping the medium stable was the most troublesome part, and I came up with a solution for that for our final product. More on that later.

### What I made
Along with my teammate Miguel, at the Corvallis art walk, we mounted the weather baloon to a light fixture at the display room using cheap, rudimentary materials and it went pretty well considering. The projectors and spherical medium created the unique effect that we were going for, and I'm happy with how it turned out. I was only there to set up everything for function: I couldn't be there for the whole show. However, we took a picture with a photo of me projected onto the sphere and it looks pretty good.

### Connection to the project
With this knowledge and the solutions me and the team have come up with for the practical problems regarding some speed bumps we had in mounting our prototype for display, we believe we have found the best way to make the final project stable and well lit.
