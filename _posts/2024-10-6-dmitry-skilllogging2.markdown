(20 points) Brief reflection/recountment of what you learned (200 words maximum). Specifically, you will likely need to do independent reading/searching to learn some of these new skills. Where did you look, and what did you read or learn about? Include references as appropriate (you should have at least one in most cases), and make sure the writing is in your own words. For the purposes of this assignment, it is not sufficient to learn without external resources.

What I learned this past week was the setup of the projectors and balloon. In the computer lab we did a mock test of our project and found our shortcomings. On the technical side I figured out how to set up the computers and projectors and how to aim and position the throw beam using software. Both projectors were panasonic so I found how to use them through youtube tutorials and troubleshooting.

(15 points) Artifact related to what you learned (i.e., an image or video from your specific efforts). Note that this should be captured by you and not (for example) images copied from a tutorial that you used. This part should capture your attempt to follow or digest the learning material in some way (for example, a screenshot or photo showing your own work beside a tutorial page, a photo of you attending a relevant crafting workshop, etc.).

(20 points) Brief reflection/recountment of what you made (200 words maximum). For example, you might have tried making art in a new style or using a new software, learned a new makerspace skill, written code in a new language, etc. Tell me about this process.

Going into this I had never used a projector before, only having limited experience with viewing them in school or at the movie theater. In the setup I learned how to control light levels and ranges, through software and the built in interface on the projector. We also had some problems with the resolution quality on the projector and I dove in, to try and figure out the cause. In our case we had 4k projectors but were projecting a 720p video on it leading to a pixellike image display. Also learned how to block out sections of the projection to remove unwanted colors in the background.


(15 points) Artifact related to what you made (same instructions/stipulations as for the first mentioned artifact). Building on the previously mentioned examples, you might have produced/shared a final art piece, taken a video of part of the process or snapshot of the final product, or made a screen recording of you running your code for the first time, for example.

(15 points) Tie this effort back into the class by briefly describing how it connects to both the course topic and your team's project (150 words maximum).

This ties in to the team as it is the core of our project, it's what we've focused on the whole time and is the main attention grabber. We want to create an immersive experience where you're almost sucked into the globe, and the dynamic visual displays are part of that. As this class is Creative Collaboration, this does tie in requiring the whole team to set it up, it also has some meaning as all good art projects should have focusing on the environment and bringing notice to it.
