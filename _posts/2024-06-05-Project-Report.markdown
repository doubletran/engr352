### Pitch
Experience "Space Walk," a unique visual installation showcasing Earth as never seen before. Using advanced projection technology, this exhibit casts dynamic representations of Earth, including normal and wildfire data overlays, onto a spherical medium. This setup invites viewers on a contemplative journey through the art of data visualization, engaging them with the planet's beauty and environmental complexities.

### Cultural Concept
"Space Walk" engages viewers by visually representing Earth in a manner that echoes humanity’s enduring fascination with celestial observation. Historically, artists and scientists like Galileo Galilei and Étienne Léopold Trouvelot have transformed celestial observation into art, making the cosmos more accessible and stimulating public curiosity. Our project seeks to continue this tradition by using modern technology to portray Earth, aiming to deepen public engagement with our planet's visual and environmental narratives.

### Artistic Merit
Drawing inspiration from Galileo’s groundbreaking "Moon watercolors," and Étienne Léopold Trouvelot’s detailed "Astronomical Drawings," "Space Walk" endeavors to connect historical celestial exploration with contemporary artistic expression. By projecting highly detailed images of Earth onto a weather balloon, we create a platform for viewers to engage with our planet in a manner reminiscent of how early astronomers invited the public to marvel at their detailed artistic renderings of celestial phenomena.

### Core Technology
"Space Walk" utilizes a dual projector system controlled by TouchDesigner to animate Earth's depiction on a spherical canvas. ArcGIS supports the backend by rendering Earth data, including live wildfire information, which adds a dynamic and educational layer to the exhibit. Despite challenges such as synchronizing the projectors, the technology setup provided a robust platform for public engagement and artistic expression.

### User Evaluation Methods
Instead of formal surveys, our evaluation approach relied on informal conversations and observations during the presentation of the project. This method allowed for spontaneous and genuine feedback, capturing the immediate reactions and interactions of the viewers with the exhibit.

### User Evaluation Results
The feedback gathered from the audience was generally positive, with many expressing admiration for the visual appeal and innovative use of projection technology. Conversations with viewers highlighted their fascination with the detailed and dynamic portrayal of Earth, underscoring the project's success in creating an immersive and educational experience.

### Conclusion
"Space Walk" successfully merges art, technology, and environmental science in a captivating exhibit that encourages public engagement with our planet's imagery and data. As we continue to refine our technical setup and expand our thematic content, "Space Walk" will serve as a foundational experience in our artistic and technological development.
