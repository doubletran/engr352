### Recap on User Evaluation Pilot

Our user evaluation pilot was a valuable learning experience. We discovered that people generally enjoy projectors, but we also learned the importance of having accessible outlets and long cables for our setup. While we didn't collect formal data, we engaged in several positive conversations with viewers. Initially, presenting wildfire data alienated some attendees due to its somber nature. We adjusted by showcasing a simple Earth projection, which was better received. The pilot revealed that our setup needed more stability and highlighted the importance of considering the rotation and angles of the projectors. Overall, it was a success because we identified key areas for improvement and made necessary adjustments for future presentations.

### Data Collected During User Evaluation Pilot

Although we didn't conduct formal surveys, our informal conversations provided qualitative insights. Visitors expressed appreciation for the visual appeal and innovative use of projection technology. They were particularly fascinated by the detailed and dynamic portrayal of Earth. To analyze these interactions, we noted recurring themes in feedback, such as the emotional impact of the wildfire data and the overall engagement with the Earth projection.

### Recap of Exhibition So Far

The exhibition has been going well. Visitors have shared interesting ideas, such as using different types of data visualizations that aren't necessarily somber. The setup process was smoother the second time around; we knew what to do and how to do it. However, it would have been beneficial to have an automatic adjustment for the projection and a better understanding of TouchDesigner. Overall, the experience has been positive, with useful feedback and a more stable setup compared to our initial presentation.

### Conclusion

Overall, the exhibition and user evaluation pilot provided us with invaluable insights and highlighted areas for improvement. We look forward to implementing these adjustments in future presentations to enhance the viewer experience and the stability of our setup.
